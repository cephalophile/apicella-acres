More eggs! 

Why pay $5 for factory eggs at the store when you can get game fresh, organic eggs from a neighbor? 

Fresh eggs for sale! 

We have a backyard flock of happy hens who produce more eggs than we can eat. We've just restocked the egg fridge at the end of our driveway. Each carton is a rainbow dozen of ungraded eggs. We sell both washed and unwashed eggs - washed egg cartons will be marked as such. 

Why buy unwashed eggs? Eggs are laid with a "bloom" which is a protective coating that protects them from contamination. You can store unwashed eggs on the counter for 2-4 weeks! Once washed they MUST be refrigerated, but the easiest way is to wash them as needed before use. 

Egg cartons are recycled paper with soy-based ink and can be recycled or composted (or even, better, returned! Just leave empty cartons in the fridge).
