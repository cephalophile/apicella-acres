              As a silky, it took many months for Zumi to reveal himself as
              a rooster! Be that as it may, he's grown into a fine boy who
              keeps a watchful eye over his girls and informs them when any
              exceptionally tasty tidbits have been found. Zumi is also an
              unusually docile rooster - he really doesn't mind being held!

              Our girl Wally decided this spring she wanted to be a mama! She 
              sat and sat on her (fake, though she didn't know it) eggs. Her determination 
              proved to us she was ready for parenthood. On May 7 we brought home a 
              group of 8 pullets (female baby chicks). She has been a doting and protective mother
              ever since. Welcome to the homestead, baby chicks!
