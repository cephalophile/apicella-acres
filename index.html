            <p class="description"> We moved here from the cold and gray northeast state of CT in 2019. Our first few years 
            were a struggle to get on our feet, but eventually we were able to purchase the first
            leg in the Apicella Acres journey; a small 1.5 acre piece of land with a 100-year old 
            house! Since then we've been doing our best to make improvements and learn to create a space hospitable to both 
            ourselves and the ecosystem around us.</p>

            <p class="description text-end">It's always been a dream of ours to keep chickens. What started as four
            hens to keep eggs in our cupboard quickly turned in eight, thirteen, nineteen... twenty-two hens with soon to be 
            over dozen eggs a day! To say we love chickens might be an understatement. Our
            dream is to keep even more chickens and perhaps one day operate as a rescue
            for chickens and other farm fowl.</p>

            Our girls go into the garden to help clean up at the end of every growing 
            season. They also receive all of our garden and kitchen scraps (with additional
            scratch grains and dried bugs for treats)! Our garden is a constant experiment in 
            new vegetables, flowers, regenerative growing, and permaculture ("the conscious design and 
            maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability, 
            and resilience of natural ecosystems" - <a class="inPlink" href="https://www.permaculturenews.org/what-is-permaculture/">Permacultre Research Institute</a>).

<div class="sustainabilityContainer" id="SUSTAINABILITY">
    <h3 class="mb-5">Striving for Sustainability</h3>
    <div class="susSectionContainer">
        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">Why chickens?</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">We always wanted to find a way to reduce our imprint on the 
            world around us and work in tandum with nature. Chickens help 
            us with just that! They are great composters, turning kitchen 
            scraps into eggs. They add their own manure to our compost 
            piles which are added to our garden. From there our garden 
            grows us food, of which the scraps go back to the chickens. 
            Even the shells of eggs can either be fed back to the flock 
            or added as a soil amendment.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">Keeping your eggs</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">Fresh eggs do not require refrigeration. The important part is 
            not to wash them until you're ready to use them. Eggs are laid 
            with something called a bloom. The bloom is a protective coating 
            that keeps pathogens from penetrating the shell. As long as the 
            egg's bloom remains intact, eggs can be kept on the counter for 
            2 - 4 weeks. After that they can be stored in the refrigerator. If you
            choose to wash your eggs, or purcahsed pre-washed eggs, they will need to be refrigerated immediately.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-3 mb-3">How can you help?</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">We package our eggs in compostable and recyclable cartons, stamped 
            with plant based ink. However, we always appreciate if you can return 
            them so they can be used again!
            <br><br>
            Did you know that food waste accounts for 20% of methane released from 
            landfills? Methane is a greenhouse gas with 80x the warming power of 
            carbon dioxide. Instead of sending them to the dump, egg shells can be 
            composted or dried in the oven, ground, and added to garden or potted plant soil for 
            healthier plants.</p>
